            <h3 class="oswald-medium text-red">Banners</h3>
            <p class=" text-white">Banners can be used for a range of purposes. Bring them to conventions to increase brand recognition and value, or use them in house to call out new products and promotions. For nearly every event your company hosts or attends, a custom banner can help spread your marketing message.</p>
            <h3 class="oswald-medium text-red">Outdoor and Indoor</h3>
            <p class=" text-white">Banners are made for use in both indoor and outdoor situations. This is why you can choose outdoor-quality vinyl for advertising on the exterior of your business or storefront. Indoor banners stand up to regular use inside your business, and both types offer long-lasting durability.</p>
