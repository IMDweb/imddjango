            <p class="text-gray">Our indoor wall murals and custom wall paper are ideal for large indoor wall spaces, where texturing is a consideration. We print our wall murals and custom wallpaper on a wallpaper-like material, specially formulated for our large-format printer. Our wall murals and custom wallpaper is affixed to a wall like traditional wallpaper. This application is ideal for homes, offices and corporate suites – places where the consumer’s creative demands typically exceed the limits of wallpaper.</p>
